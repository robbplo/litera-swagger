{"swagger":"2.0","info":{"version":"v1","title":"Version 1 of the Micron API","description":"## OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nTop Performance is a leading-edge performance management software by Micron Systems, the industry leader with more than 25 years of experience providing software specialized for the legal and accounting industries.\r\n\r\nTop Performance implements a comprehensive collection of REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs. These APIs allow you to pull data from, add data to, and modify or remove data within Top Performance with precision and ease. Most functionality offered within the application can also be accessed through the APIs.\r\n\r\n## FEATURES\r\n\r\n* Manage your firm's Maintenance Tables\r\n\r\n* Configure Security Roles and Groups\r\n\r\n* Import Employee data\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** This documentation is for the v1.0 of the APIs.\r\n\r\n## POLICIES\r\n\r\n### Deprecation Policy:\r\n\r\nThe current version of production level APIs is v1. When a new version of APIs is made generally available, the older version will be deprecated and will cease to function after six months. Once an API is removed, any request to it will result in a 404 error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** We will not remove any API until similar functionality is present in the new version\r\n\r\n\r\n### Breaking Change Policy:\r\n\r\nChanges that do not break an API, such as adding a new attribute can be made at any time. Changes that break a production level API such as removing attributes or making major changes to the API’s behavior will only be done with an advance notice of 60 days. However, there may be rare occasions where due to legal, performance, or security reasons, we are forced to make breaking changes without advance notice.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### AUTHENTICATION\r\n\r\nThe firms who wish to use the Top Performance APIs will be given a client_id and client_secret. These will be provided upon request.\r\nTo get an access token to call Top Performance APIs, do a POST call to the below endpoint:\r\n`/oauth/v1/token`\r\n\r\n#####Request Parameters in Header:\r\n| Param \t| Description                                   \t|\r\n|--------\t|-------------------------------------------\t|\r\n| `Authorization`   \t| The client_id and client_secret must be passed in the authorization header through Basic HTTP authorization.
